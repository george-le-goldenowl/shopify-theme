            <p>You may or may not have noticed… wireless tattoo machines have taken the industry by storm. Maybe
                you’ve considered swapping out your cords to glean the benefits of a wireless model. Or maybe
                you’ve already hopped on the wireless bandwagon and you’re seeking your next go-to machine.
                Either way, this wireless tattoo machine guide is for you. You’ll find everything you could
                possibly want out of a wireless machine: lining, packing, and shading capabilities, intuitive
                features from top-rated brands, and more.
                So, let’s get to it: Level up your top drawer with the best wireless tattoo machines on the
                market and enjoy tattooing with cord-free versatility.</p>
            <h3>FK IRONS FLUX MAX</h3>

            <p>With the FK Irons Flux Max, you can super-size your tattooing potential with quite a few features
                that build on FK Irons’s former wireless machine models. Artists who love to pull big, bold,
                crispy lines will want to give this one a go for sure. That’s because the FK Irons Flux Max
                comes in three stroke lengths, including 4.5mm, which is the largest stroke length FK Irons has
                ever offered. Consequently, not only do you get the convenience of an easily adjustable stroke
                length — you also get the ideal stroke length for your boldest work.

                Additionally, the Flux Max comes with an updated PowerBolt battery pack: The PowerBolt II. This
                revamped battery gives you a clear, digital OLED readout of your voltage and session timer.
                Adjust your voltage in 0.1mm increments with the press of a button using this clear,
                easy-to-read interface. Plus, the PowerBolt II lets you have eGive without having to connect to
                the Darklab app.

                On top of these bonus features, the Flux Max has the benefits of the original Flux wireless
                tattoo machine design: an ergonomic grip and a forward-weighted body for maximum control.</p>
            <p>If you’re looking for a bold liner wireless machine, you might find your savior in the Dragonhawk
                Mast Lancer wireless tattoo machine. A simple turn of the adjustment knob lets you change your
                needle depth up to 4mm for pulling your crispiest lines… but with its 3.5mm stroke length, the
                Mast Lancer is versatile enough for all kinds of tattooing. Additionally, you can count on
                plenty of battery life with the Dragonhawk Mast Lancer, which delivers 12+ hours of tattooing
                power per charge. Its balanced design weighs a little more than some of the lighter weight
                machines in this round-up, which is perfect for artists who like a little more heft.</p>
